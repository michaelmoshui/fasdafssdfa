## Overview
WildSafe is an iOS application designed to assist users during wildfire emergencies.

## Key Features

### 1. **Incident Reporting**
- **Quick and Easy**: Users can report emergencies by simply pressing a button—no typing required.
- **Location Tracking**: The app automatically captures the user's latitude and longitude to identify the incident location.
- **Fire Incident Highlighting**: When the "Fire" button is clicked, the app marks the fire's location on the map with a red circular area.

### 2. **Resource Tracking and Sharing**
- **Five Reporting Categories**:
  - **Fire**
  - **Food**
  - **Fire Trucks**
  - **Health Services**
  - **Gas Stations**
- **Need vs. Have Buttons**: For the four resource categories (Food, Fire Trucks, Health, and Gas Stations), the app provides two buttons:
  - **Need**: Indicates the user requires a resource.
  - **Have**: Indicates the user has a resource to provide.

### 3. **Dynamic List Management**
- **Real-Time Updates**: Resources and incident reports are dynamically added to a shared list.
- **Comprehensive Details**: Each entry in the list includes the user's location, type of resource or incident, and whether it is marked as "Need" or "Have."
- **Live Tracking**: The app continuously monitors and updates user locations in real-time.
